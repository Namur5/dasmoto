# Dasmoto's Arts & Crafts

One of the first projects you will be asked to create when learning HTML and CSS on Codecademy. It is the first project I ever created while using Github.

## Getting Started

A basic static html website without anything fancy. I doubt it will ever get used.

## Deployment

Clone and open on your machine. Not worth doing that or anything else with it.

## Built With

* [ATOM](https://atom.io/) - The text editor used
* [Github](https://github.com) - Allowing me to learn git/github
* [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com) - For the challenge

## Contributing

This project has been completed in far more depth many times. Do not contribute.
